# workrave-pause
Simple script to pause music when workrave (http://www.workrave.org/) enforces a break

This is a slightly modified version of the [mouse-speed script](https://github.com/rcaelers/workrave/blob/branch_v1_10/contrib/mouse-speed/dbus-penalty.py) from the workrave repository.

It takes the first music player it finds and pauses it whenever there is an enforced
break.

There is a lot of code from the original script that is not needed here, but
I keep it as documentation and possibly future use.

License is GPL3 as workrave is.
